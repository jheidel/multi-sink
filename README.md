# multi-sink

A bash script wrapping pipewire module-combine-sink to route audio to multiple outputs at once.

Useful for sharing audio across multiple bluetooth headphones, like a virtual headphone splitter.

Once the multi-sink is set up, you can use the `pavucontrol` to further fine-tune volumes and even individual sink delays to get perfect synchronization between all sinks.
